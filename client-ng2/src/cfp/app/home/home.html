        One of our core value is to make the conference accessible to the vast majority. The purpose is to gather everyone around, from managers
        to developers, even the ones who have to pay by their own because their consulting company or their non-funded startup wonâ€™t pay for them.
        You can purpose talks or workshop for beginers or confirmed people. Because all the profiles are present at Mix-IT. We need to find
        sessions for all the attendees.
